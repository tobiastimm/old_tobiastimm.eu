My first contact with Java was in my apprenticeship at [Ewert Ahrensburg Electronic (EAE)](https://eae.com). One of our trainers was the co-leader in the java department and after 2 years with C#, I've decided to swap into his department.

Within this year I have learned the basics of object oriented programming, created several Swing applications and prepared my final project for the apprenticeship.
It was a database configurator based on Java Server Faces 1 with EJB 3 on a JBoss application server. I really liked Java compared to C#, so I've decided to apply as a Java developer and improved my knowledge about Spring, Dependency Injection, JUnit and Maven.

[Mediaface GmbH](http://www.mediaface.de/de/) was my first job as a Java developer. The first project I was assigned to was the [PraxiKettÂ© Designer](https://www.mediaform.de/medizinprodukte/medikationskennzeichnung/praxikett-designer-infopaket/), a web based solution to organize and print labels for the hospital section. This project became my little child and I have grown together with it. It was built on Spring, Hibernate, JPA with Java Server Faces 2 running in a Tomcat web server. The build system was made with Maven.
Within these years I've learned to use SVN, migrated our build system to gradle, later migrated SVN to git, set up a Jenkins server and many many more.
