C# was the first object oriented programming language I've learned in my apprenticeship at [Ewert Ahrensburg Electronic (EAE)](https://eae.com). 
Our trainer showed us the basics and we began to create our first Windows Forms applications, where all the logic was in a single button. Later we've learned the MVC-Pattern and designed several different projects, like a chat, a flight-booking software including MS SQL Server etc.

I realy liked the ideas and features of C#, but compared to Java I wasn't satisfied with the different approaches to implement the same feature in C#. Also the build and dependency management with NuGet was extremly poor compared to ant with ivy, maven or gradle.

After I have learned java, C# became something for me like a language for corner cases. I've only used where our customers didn't want to install Java on their machines, or we needed to create a Windows only solution anyway.
