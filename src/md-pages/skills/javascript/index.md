During my time at [Mediaface GmbH](http://www.mediaface.de/de/) I had barely contact with JavaScript, just some jQuery and basic DOM manipulation.

One day our designer and me were assigned to a new prototype that we should implement in AngularJS. I had one week to get into it and after I learned the basics about npm, grunt, yeoman and bower I fell in love with JS.

Since when I try to learn new things in the JS universe on a daily bases. I've changed our build system from grunt to gulp to just npm, learned TypeScript, implemented a small desktop app with electron and Angular 2 beta, accquired skills in webpack and learned about react.

While I was learning react, redux and all the other parts I need to know, I've recognized that JS is my go to language nowadays.
My last task was the migration from grunt to a webpack build system within our AngularJS 1.X app to introduce ES6+ syntax and many more features like TypeScript, eslint, .... .
